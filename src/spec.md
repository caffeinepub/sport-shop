# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Allow shoppers to choose a payment method during checkout without integrating third-party payment processors or collecting real payment details.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a payment method selection step/section in the checkout flow (e.g., options like Cash on Delivery and Pay on Delivery).
- Persist the selected payment method as part of the order/checkout submission so it appears in order details/confirmation.

**User-visible outcome:** During checkout, users can select a payment method and see that choice reflected when placing and reviewing the order.
