# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Ensure each product’s name is clearly shown across the existing UI wherever products are presented.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the product list cards so each product’s name is rendered as visible English text on every card (not only via image alt text).
- Update the product details view to display the selected product’s name prominently as the page title/header in English.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can clearly see product names on both the product listing cards and the product details page header, with all product-name-related UI text shown in English.
