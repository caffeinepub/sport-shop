  "summary": "Frontend adds Checkout and Order Confirmation views and wires basic navigation and cart clearing, but backend order placement (Motoko actor changes) is not present in the diff summary, and some checkout edge-case behaviors are not fully evidenced due to truncation.",

      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Add backend order placement so the Checkout view can place an order and receive an order identifier (order data model, createOrder method, persisted canister state).",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows no changes to backend/main.mo (or any backend files) implementing an order model, a public createOrder method, or persisted order storage.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: Added/Modified files list contains only frontend files; no backend/main.mo changes shown.",

      "requirement": "If the backend create-order call fails, show a non-technical English error message and allow retrying without losing typed form inputs.",
      "reason": "CheckoutView includes a submitError state, but the error-handling UI/wording and retry behavior are not visible in the provided truncated content, so this acceptance criterion is not confirmed by the diff summary.",

      "requirement": "The “Place order” button shows a loading state while the order is being submitted and prevents duplicate submissions.",
      "reason": "CheckoutView defines isSubmitting state, but the actual button rendering/disabled/loading behavior is not visible in the truncated diff content, so this acceptance criterion is not confirmed.",
      "evidence": [
